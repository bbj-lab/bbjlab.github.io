										Brett Beaulieu-Jones is an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago. His research seeks to understand the relationship between technology and health care delivery, including the deployment of machine learning and informatics tools, and the extraction of robust insights from real-world biomedical data. Dr. Beaulieu-Jones received a National Institutes of Health Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He has had multiple publications recognized among the American Medical Informatics Associationâ€™s Year in Review top 10 papers in clinical informatics. He earned his PhD in genomics and computational biology from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His thesis, which was recognized by the American Medical Informatics Association, focused on the development and application of machine learning and informatics methods to clinical data to identify biologically or clinically interesting patient subpopulations. He then completed a postdoctoral fellowship and served as a junior faculty member in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. He served as the general chair for the Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) workshop at NeurIPS, is a founding organizer for the Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Learning Health Systems and is the chair of the Association for Health Learning and Inference (AHLI, parent organization of ML4H and the Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning). He has a strong interest in entrepreneurship and has helped start and lead venture backed companies from founding to acquisition.
